The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide for the 
use of pretrial motions to narrow and clarify the scope 
of litigation. Most clients, however, do not have finan-
cial resources to file every available motion, nor is every 
motion practically feasible. As a practical matter, attorneys 
must consider whether a motion’s potential for adding 
value to the case as a whole is worth the expense to the 
client. This article recommends using standards of review 
as a guide in deciding which pretrial motions to file in a 
federal civil case. Although the article references case law 
from the Fifth Circuit, the underlying recommendations are 
appropriate for all jurisdictions.
What is a Standard of Review? 
“At its clearest level, a standard of review prescribes the 
degree of deference given by the reviewing court to the 
actions or decisions under review.”1 “[T]he applicable stan-
dard of review tends to reflect the appellate courts’ accu-
mulated wisdom as to which issues deserve their attention 
and which issues should be left primarily to front-line trial 
courts and agencies.”2 As a general rule, the more discre-
tion a trial judge has, the more deferential the applicable 
appellate standard of review.
Abuse of discretion is one of the most deferential stan-
dards of review. A reviewing court uses this standard to 
review rulings for which the law gives the trial judge dis-
cretion to decide. When reviewing for abuse of discretion, 
the appellate court does not ask whether it would have 
made the same ruling as an original matter, but, instead, 
whether the district court abused its discretion under the 
applicable standards of determination of any motion.3 
Thus, the district court need not have been “right” to be 
upheld by the appellate court;4 instead, the lower court 
needs only to remain within its discretion. For this reason, 
an abuse of discretion is difficult to show on appeal.
In contrast, “de novo review requires an appellate court 
to review the case anew, without any formal deference to 
the decision below … .5 De novo review is typically applied 
to conclusions of law as opposed to factual determina-
tions.”6 Under this standard, the appellate court reviews the 
district court’s legal conclusions de novo, giving no defer-
ence to the lower court’s decision while taking the facts in 
the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.7 Although 
the appellate court owes the district court no deference, 
“[i]ndependent appellate review necessarily entails a careful 
consideration of the district court’s legal analysis, and an 
efficient and sensitive appellate court at least will naturally 
consider this analysis in undertaking its review.”8
Why Consider Standards of Review?
As a trial attorney, your familiarity with standards of 
review may seem of little benefit or import to your prac-
tice. However, knowing and understanding standards of 
review can be valuable guideposts to determining the 
value and probable success of a certain action. In addition, 
because standards of review serve as important guides to 
seasoned trial judges who consider how their decisions 
will be reviewed if challenged, knowing the applicable 
standard of review can help a trial attorney frame argu-
