UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
Case No. 17-CV-22643 COOKE/GOODMAN 
 
 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION, 
 
 
 
 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
vs. 
 
DAVID RIVERA, 
 
 
 
 
 
Defendant. 
 
 
 
 
 
MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION 
 
Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendant, DAVID RIVERA 
respectfully moves this Court to dismiss this case with prejudice for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction and states: 
LEGAL STANDARD APPLICABLE TO RULE 12(B)(1) MOTIONS 
“Federal courts have limited subject-matter jurisdiction, and the party invoking the court’s 
jurisdiction bears the burden of proving it exists.” Orchid Quay, LLC v. Suncor Bristol Bay, LLC, 
178 F.Supp.3d 1300, 1302 (S.D. Fla. 2016) (citing McCormick v. Aderholt, 293 F.3d 1254, 1257 
(11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam)).  A party, or a court on its own initiative, can challenge whether the 
court has subject matter jurisdiction, at any time, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). Arbaugh v. Y&H 
Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 506 (2006). Further, “Rule 12(h)(3) instructs: ‘[w]henever it appears by 
suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the 
court shall dismiss the action.’” Id. (quoting Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 455 (2004)). A 
different standard of review applies to Rule 12(b)(1) motions depending on whether the challenge  
is facial or factual.  As the Eleventh Circuit explained in Stalley ex rel. U.S. v. Orlando Reg'l 
Healthcare Sys., Inc., 524 F.3d 1229, 1232–33 (11th Cir. 2008):
