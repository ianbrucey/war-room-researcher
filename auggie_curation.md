## I. FOUNDATIONAL PLEADING STANDARDS

### A. The Plausibility Standard (Twombly/Iqbal Doctrine)

**Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly**, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) ✓ VERIFIED
- Established the "plausibility" standard for evaluating complaints
- Replaced the "possibility" standard from earlier notice pleading doctrine
- Requires allegations that raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence supporting the claim
- Applies to all civil actions, not just antitrust cases
- Plaintiff must provide enough facts to state a plausible claim for relief

**Ashcroft v. Iqbal**, 556 U.S. 662 (2009) ✓ VERIFIED
- Refined and reinforced the plausibility standard
- Established two-pronged approach: (1) identify well-pleaded factual allegations; (2) assume their truth and determine if they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief
- Requires more than labels and conclusions or formulaic recitation of elements
- Distinguishes between factual allegations (accepted as true) and legal conclusions (not accepted)
- Applies the plausibility standard to all Rule 12(b)(6) motions

### B. Notice Pleading Principles

- Plaintiff must provide fair notice of the nature and basis of the claim
- Complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations
- However, bare assertions and conclusory statements are insufficient
- Heightened pleading standards apply to certain categories (fraud, securities violations)

## II. RULE 12(b)(1) - LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION

### Key Principles

**Subject Matter Jurisdiction Requirements:**
- Federal courts have limited jurisdiction (federal question or diversity)
- Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by parties
- Court must have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action
- Lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time

**Facial vs. Factual Challenges:**
- **Facial Challenge:** Attacks the complaint on its face; court accepts all well-pleaded allegations as true
- **Factual Challenge:** Disputes the truth of factual allegations; may require evidentiary hearing

**Kontrick v. Ryan**, 540 U.S. 443 (2004) ✓ VERIFIED
- Addresses procedural requirements for subject matter jurisdiction
- Establishes that certain procedural rules are not jurisdictional
- Important for distinguishing jurisdictional from non-jurisdictional defects

- Established that purposeful availment of the forum state is required

- Clarified that general jurisdiction requires continuous and systematic presence in the forum state

- Restricted general jurisdiction to cases where defendant is "essentially at home" in the forum state
- For individuals: domicile is the paradigm forum for general jurisdiction
- For corporations: principal place of business is the paradigm forum for general jurisdiction
- Presence of subsidiaries or affiliates does not establish general jurisdiction over parent company

**Hanson v. Denckla**, 357 U.S. 235 (1958) ✓ VERIFIED
- Foundational case establishing that defendant must have purposefully availed itself of the forum state
- Unilateral activity of third parties cannot establish jurisdiction

## IX. KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR PRACTITIONERS

1. **Plausibility is the Standard:** Twombly/Iqbal plausibility standard applies to all Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Bare assertions and conclusory statements are insufficient.

2. **Jurisdiction is Critical:** Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. Personal jurisdiction requires minimum contacts and purposeful availment. Venue is a matter of convenience.

3. **Heightened Pleading Applies:** Fraud, securities violations, and certain other claims require heightened pleading standards beyond general notice pleading.

4. **Distinguish Jurisdictional from Non-Jurisdictional:** Not all statutory requirements are jurisdictional. Arbaugh framework helps determine what defects can be waived.

5. **Minimum Contacts Test:** Personal jurisdiction requires continuous and systematic presence (general) or purposeful direction of activities at the forum state (specific).

6. **Daimler Limits General Jurisdiction:** General jurisdiction is now limited to cases where defendant is "essentially at home" in the forum state.
