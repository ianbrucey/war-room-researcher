# Curated Summary of Legal Precedents for Motions to Dismiss

## Introduction

This document summarizes key legal precedents and principles related to motions to dismiss in U.S. federal courts, based on an analysis of provided legal texts. The focus is on motions filed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 12, particularly subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(6). All citations have been verified using the `lookup_citation` tool.

## Motions to Dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(1) (Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction)

A motion under FRCP 12(b)(1) challenges the court's authority to hear a case. Federal courts have limited jurisdiction, and the party bringing the suit bears the burden of proving that subject-matter jurisdiction exists.

### Key Principles:

*   **Facial vs. Factual Challenges:** A 12(b)(1) motion can present a "facial" challenge, which takes the allegations in the complaint as true, or a "factual" challenge, which allows the court to consider evidence beyond the pleadings to resolve disputed jurisdictional facts.
*   **Court's Obligation:** A court can and must dismiss a case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any point in the proceedings if it becomes apparent that jurisdiction is lacking, as stated in *Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp.*, 546 U.S. 500 (2006).
*   **Priority of Jurisdictional Questions:** When grounds for dismissal exist under both Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), courts should prioritize the 12(b)(1) motion. This principle was discussed in *Rhurgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co.*, 526 U.S. 574 (1999), which held that while not always required, it is often preferable for a court to establish its jurisdiction before ruling on the merits of a claim.

## Motions to Dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(2) (Lack of Personal Jurisdiction)

A motion under FRCP 12(b)(2) argues that the court does not have power over the defendant. The plaintiff bears the burden of making a prima facie showing that personal jurisdiction exists.

### Key Principles:

The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that a defendant have "minimum contacts" with the forum state such that the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend "traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice." This leads to two main types of personal jurisdiction: general and specific.

#### General Jurisdiction

General jurisdiction allows a court to hear any and all claims against a defendant, regardless of whether the claims arise from their contacts with the forum state.

*   **"At Home" Standard:** The Supreme Court has significantly narrowed the scope of general jurisdiction. In *Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown*, 564 U.S. 915 (2011), the Court held that a corporation is subject to general jurisdiction only where it is essentially "at home."
*   **Paradigm Forums:** *Daimler AG v. Bauman*, 571 U.S. 117 (2014), clarified that the "paradigm" forums for a corporation to be considered "at home" are its place of incorporation and its principal place of business. It is "incredibly difficult" to establish general jurisdiction elsewhere.

#### Specific Jurisdiction

Specific jurisdiction exists when the lawsuit arises out of or relates to the defendant's contacts with the forum state.

*   **Purposeful Availment:** The defendant must have "purposefully availed" itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state. This was a key element in *Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz*, 471 U.S. 462 (1985).
*   **Reasonable Anticipation of Being Haled into Court:** The defendant's conduct and connection with the forum state must be such that it should "reasonably anticipate being haled into court there," as established in *World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson*, 444 U.S. 286 (1980).
*   **Contacts Must Be Continuous and Systematic (for General Jurisdiction):** *Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall*, 466 U.S. 408 (1984), held that mere purchases, even if occurring at regular intervals, are not enough to warrant a State's assertion of *in personam* jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action not related to those purchase transactions.

## Motions to Dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(6) (Failure to State a Claim)

This is one of the most common dispositive motions. It argues that even if all the factual allegations in the complaint are true, they do not state a legally recognized claim for relief.

### The "Plausibility" Standard: *Twombly* and *Iqbal*

The Supreme Court reshaped the 12(b)(6) landscape with two landmark decisions that introduced the "plausibility" standard.

*   ***Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*, 550 U.S. 544 (2007):** This case retired the half-century-old "no set of facts" standard from *Conley v. Gibson*. The Court held that a complaint must contain "enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest" that a claim is plausible. A claim has "facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."
*   ***Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662 (2009):** *Iqbal* confirmed that the *Twombly* plausibility standard applies to all civil cases, not just antitrust suits. It established a two-pronged approach for courts to use when considering a motion to dismiss:
    1.  First, identify and disregard any "threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements."
    2.  Second, take the remaining well-pleaded factual allegations as true and determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.

### Pre-Twombly Standard: *Conley v. Gibson*

*   ***Conley v. Gibson*, 355 U.S. 41 (1957):** For 50 years, *Conley* provided the standard for 12(b)(6) motions. It stated that a complaint should not be dismissed "unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief." This lenient "notice pleading" standard was explicitly retired by *Twombly*.

### Securities Litigation and Heightened Pleading

*   ***Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd.*, 551 U.S. 308 (2007):** In the context of securities fraud, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) requires plaintiffs to "state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind." *Tellabs* interpreted this to mean that an inference of scienter must be "cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged."

## Other Important Precedents

*   ***Basic Inc. v. Levinson*, 485 U.S. 224 (1988):** While not a motion to dismiss case, *Basic* is fundamental in securities litigation. It established the "fraud-on-the-market" theory, which provides a presumption of reliance for plaintiffs in securities fraud class actions, a key element that often survives a 12(b)(6) challenge if the other elements are well-pleaded.

## Conclusion

The legal standards for motions to dismiss have evolved significantly, particularly for FRCP 12(b)(6) motions following the *Twombly* and *Iqbal* decisions. The shift from "conceivable" to "plausible" has imposed a more rigorous pleading standard on plaintiffs. For jurisdictional challenges under 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(2), the principles remain more established, with a clear focus on the court's power to hear the case and its power over the defendants, respectively. Understanding these precedents is critical for navigating the early stages of federal litigation.
